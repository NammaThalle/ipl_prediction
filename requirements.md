# IPL Prediction System Requirements Document

## Overview
The IPL Prediction System aims to predict various outcomes related to the Indian Premier League (IPL), including but not limited to:
- Predicting the winner of the IPL season.
- Predicting the Man of the Match for each match.
- Predicting other awards and outcomes (e.g., Orange Cap, Purple Cap).

This document outlines the requirements for building the system, including data sources, algorithms, and system architecture.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Prediction Features
- **Season Winner Prediction**: Predict the team most likely to win the IPL season.
- **Match Winner Prediction**: Predict the winner of individual matches.
- **Man of the Match Prediction**: Predict the player most likely to be awarded Man of the Match for each game.
- **Award Predictions**:
  - Orange Cap (highest run-scorer)
  - Purple Cap (highest wicket-taker)
  - Emerging Player of the Season

### 2. Data Handling
- **Data Sources**:
  - Historical IPL match data (scores, player stats, team stats, etc.).
  - Player performance data (batting, bowling, fielding).
  - Team composition and strategies.
  - External factors (e.g., weather, pitch conditions).
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Cleaning and normalizing data.
  - Handling missing or incomplete data.
  - Feature engineering to extract meaningful insights.

### 3. Machine Learning Models
- **Model Types**:
  - Classification models for winner predictions.
  - Regression models for performance metrics.
- **Training and Validation**:
  - Train models on historical data.
  - Validate models using cross-validation techniques.
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classification tasks.
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for regression tasks.

### 4. User Interface
- **Web Application**:
  - Dashboard to display predictions.
  - Input forms for user queries (e.g., predict match winner based on team composition).
- **Visualization**:
  - Graphs and charts for data insights.
  - Match and player statistics.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Performance
- Predictions should be generated in real-time or near real-time.
- The system should handle large datasets efficiently.

### 2. Scalability
- The system should be scalable to accommodate future IPL seasons and additional features.

### 3. Security
- Ensure data privacy and secure handling of sensitive information.

### 4. Maintainability
- The codebase should be modular and well-documented for easy updates and maintenance.

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Programming Languages and Frameworks
- **Backend**: Python (Flask/Django/FastAPI).
- **Frontend**: React.js/Angular/Vue.js.
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch.

### 2. Database
- **Relational Database**: MySQL/PostgreSQL for structured data.
- **NoSQL Database**: MongoDB for unstructured data.

### 3. APIs
- Integration with external APIs for live data (e.g., weather, player stats).

### 4. Deployment
- Cloud-based deployment (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
- CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

## Milestones

### Phase 1: Requirement Analysis
- Finalize the scope of predictions.
- Identify data sources and gather datasets.

### Phase 2: Data Preparation
- Clean and preprocess data.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).

### Phase 3: Model Development
- Train and validate machine learning models.
- Optimize models for accuracy and performance.

### Phase 4: Application Development
